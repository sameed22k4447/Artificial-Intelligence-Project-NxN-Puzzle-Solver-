# Artificial-Intelligence-Project-NxN-Puzzle-Solver-
A N by N puzzle solver using various search algorithms.
# N x N Puzzle Solver ‚Äì AI Search Algorithms

This project is an intelligent puzzle-solving application that uses classic AI search algorithms to solve N x N sliding tile puzzles (like the 8-puzzle and 15-puzzle). It features a graphical interface and supports multiple informed and uninformed search strategies.

  - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
  - A* Search (with Manhattan Distance)
  - Greedy Best-First Search

# Algorithms Overview

Each algorithm explores the puzzle state space differently:

- **BFS**: Explores all nodes level by level; guarantees shortest solution in terms of moves.
- **DFS**: Dives deep into one path before backtracking; memory-efficient but not always optimal.
- **UCS**: Explores cheapest path by total cost; optimal when all costs are non-negative.
- **Greedy Best-First**: Uses only heuristic to find the goal quickly; not guaranteed to be optimal.
- **Iterative Deepening**: Repeated DFS with increasing depth limits; combines low memory with completeness.
- **A\***: Combines path cost and heuristic; efficient and optimal with an admissible heuristic.
